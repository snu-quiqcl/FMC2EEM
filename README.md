This is QuIQCL PCB borad which converts FMC connector signals to EEM(Eurocard Extension Module) connector which is standard connector in ARTIQ PCB designs. This board can be used as daughter board with VITA57.1 and VITA57.4 FMC connector. Gigabit transciever pins are all disabled and only LA LVDS signals and I2C signals are implemented. All LVDS signal traces have 100 Ohm characteristic impedance.
